Hello ! 

My name is LaÃ¯l, software engineer with an appetite for the web domain.

I have a wide range of skills linked to my numerous professional experiences in various companies that have strengthened and enriched my skills.

I generally work on complex projects requiring :

- A technical design 
- A robust and scalable architecture
- A code respecting the conventions and the designs pattern
- Tests (TDD)
- Production (Google Cloud, Kuber, Docker, AWS)
